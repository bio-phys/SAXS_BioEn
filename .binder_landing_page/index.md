## Try BioEn without installation for SAXS data !

Click the link below to launch a computational environment (JupyterLab) in the Cloud to try the SAXS\_BioEn notebook. 

---
**Importantly**, shut down JupyterLab properly via the menu (File -> Shut Down) to free resources for other users.

[Link: Launch SAXS\_BioEn example on Binder!](https://notebooks.mpcdf.mpg.de/binder/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de%2FMPIBP-Hummer%2FSAXS_BioEn.git/HEAD?labpath=SAXS_BioEn_example.ipynb)

After launching, open the **SAXS\_BioEn\_example.ipynb** notebook and explore!

Note that the interactive session is only temporary and all its files will be deleted after termination.

### Description

Using a simple example, the Jupyter notebook SAXS\_BioEn\_example.ipynb shows how
to refine structural ensembles with BioEn (https://github.com/bio-phys/bioen)
and using SAXS data. At the end of the notebook and as an option, we evaluate
the h-statistic and (h,$\chi^2$)-statistic provided by the hplusminus software (https://github.com/bio-phys/hplusminus) to validate
the goodness-of-refinement. 

The Jupyter notebook runs using Python 3 and the current versions of the bioen
and hplusminus software.
