Click the link above to launch a computational environment (JupyterLab) in the Cloud to try the SAXS\_BioEn notebook.

**Important:** Shut down JupyterLab properly via the menu
(File -> Shut Down) to free resources for other users. Note that the interactive
session is only temporary and all its files will be deleted after termination.

## Description

Using a simple example, the Jupyter notebook SAXS\_BioEn\_example.ipynb shows how
to refine structural ensembles with BioEn (https://github.com/bio-phys/bioen)
and using SAXS data. At the end of the notebook and as an option, we evaluate
the h-statistic and (h,$\chi^2$)-statics provided by the hplusminus software (https://github.com/bio-phys/hplusminus) to validate
the goodness-of-refinement. 

The Jupyter notebook runs using Python 3 and the current versions of the bioen
and hplusminus software.
