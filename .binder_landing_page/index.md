# SAXS\_BioEn

## Introduction

Using a simple example, the Jupyter notebook SAXS\_BioEn\_example.ipynb shows how
to refine structural ensembles with BioEn (https://github.com/bio-phys/bioen)
and using SAXS data. In the end of the notebook and as an option, we evaluate
the hplusminus statistics (https://github.com/bio-phys/hplusminus) to validate
the goodness-of-refinement. 

The Jupyter notebook runs using Python 3 and the current versions of the bioen
and hplusminus software.

## Try SAXS\_BioEn interactively in a Jupyter notebook in the Cloud!

Click the link below to launch a computational environment (JupyterLab)
in the Cloud to try the SAXS\_BioEn notebook.

Important: Please remember to shut down JupyterLab properly via the menu
(File -> Shut Down) to free resources for other users. Note that the interactive
session is only temporary and all its files will be deleted after termination.
