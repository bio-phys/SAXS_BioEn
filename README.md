# SAXS_BioEn
Using a simple example, the Jupyter notebook SAXS_BioEn_example.ipynb shows how to refine structural ensembles with BioEn (https://github.com/bio-phys/bioen) and using SAXS data. In the end of the notebook and as an option, we evaluate the hplusminus statistics (https://github.com/bio-phys/hplusminus) to validate the goodness-of-refinement. 

The Jupyter notebook runs using Python 3 and the current versions of the bioen and hplusminus software.
